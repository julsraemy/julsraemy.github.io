## [A bit about me]

My name is [Julien Antoine Raemy][name] (he/him) and I come from Fribourg, Switzerland. I'm a bookseller by trade, having completed my Certificate of Vocational Education and Training in 2008. After a six-month internship in the [ELT Marketing Department of Oxford University Press][elt] in the UK and completing my military service, I spent time teaching English in Poland and working in Australia, trying to work out what to do next.

## [What I do now]

Between 2013 and 2017, I completed a Bachelor in Library and Information Science at [HEG-GE][heg] in Geneva whilst working as a Photo Archivist for the Montreux Jazz Digital Project at [EPFL's MetaMedia Center][metamedia]. I then worked as a Research and Teaching Assistant at HEG-GE, helping to coordinate the bilingual LIS curriculum whilst completing my [Master's degree in Information Science][master-is].

In 2020, I briefly worked as a Knowledge Graph Engineer and IIIF Systems Architect for the [Swiss Art Research Infrastructure][sari] before pursuing a funded PhD at the University of Basel. Between 2021 and 2024, I worked at the [Digital Humanities Lab][dhlab] on the [Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archive][pia] (PIA) research project, whilst also working as an Interoperability Specialist at [DaSCH][dasch].

I successfully defended my PhD thesis in November 2024: [Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability][phd].

From April 2024 to December 2025, I worked as a Data Scientist and Project Manager at the [Swiss Federal Archives][bar], coordinating the development of LINDASnext, a platform enabling public administrations to publish and visualise their data as knowledge graphs.

Since February 2025, I'm a Research Associate at the [Walter Benjamin Kolleg / Digital Humanities][dh-unibe], University of Bern, and since January 2026, I work as a Semantic Architect and Digital Archiving Project Manager at [docuteam][docuteam].
